Simple Keylogger

Creating a keylogger involves significant ethical and legal responsibilities. Keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, and their use without explicit consent is illegal in many jurisdictions. Always ensure that you have explicit permission from any user or organization before deploying a keylogger, and use it only for educational or authorized purposes.

Below is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library, which captures and logs keystrokes:
